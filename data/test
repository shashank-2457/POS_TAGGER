GAO 's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $ 300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs .
( Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA - and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion .

Guarantee rates are typically 100 % , giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully .
But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers , and go a long way toward reducing defaults .
Until GAO 's recent audit , FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years .
Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises , provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions , and reduce fraud .

Meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding .

In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals .

Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack .
Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy .

Even modernized , he said , the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers France has sent to meet such crises as the wars in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf .

So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on .

Pencils down .
If you 're like most people , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .

Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business .

You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .

Stevens 's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master 's -- destroys all it was designed to preserve .
But let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner ( his conscious efforts at `` banter '' always fail -- most comically ) : `` This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years : what is a ` great ' butler ?
Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of .

CHICAGO - Options traders were among the big victims of Friday 's plunging stock market , including one small firm that required an emergency $ 50 million bailout .
Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based .
The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses .
Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said .
First Options did n't have to put any money into the bailout .
The Fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well , Mr. Rawls said .

Some said Friday 's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal .
Yesterday , Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress , saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives .
Between then and his bid on Oct. 5 , the price fluctuated between $ 75.625 and $ 87.375 .
In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares .
However , other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .
`` What happened with United was a gracious way for him to bow out .

The White House budget director , prodding Congress to finish work quickly on 1990 budget bills , is trying to put some sting into the little-feared spending cuts that were triggered yesterday under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law .
Congressional leaders rejected suggestions that their attempts to speed the deficit-reduction bill had anything to do with Friday 's stock market decline .
When the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 , the Office of Management and Budget began withholding 4.3 % of the Pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money , as the Gramm-Rudman law requires .
The rest of the government will be pinched , perhaps within a month , if the cut funds are n't restored .
To quicken the pain that the spending cuts are intended to inflict , Mr. Darman said the OMB is making the cuts from each individual program , project or activity in the budget .

By late morning , the dollar had recovered somewhat and was trading at 140.90 yen and 1.8535 marks .
Not only does the dollar play a key role in determining the direction and health of the U.S. economy , but the speed with which it rises or falls is also of major concern to U.S. and foreign policy makers .
But if the U.S. currency were to decline in a controlled manner , it would contribute to the four-year effort by the U.S. and its major trading partners to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and correspondingly large Japanese and West German surpluses .
Traders concluded that U.S. interest rates would remain firm , and the dollar quickly climbed to its intraday highs of 1.9140 marks and 144.80 yen .
The G-7 includes the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada .

Many dealers are betting that the Fed will have to ease monetary policy , if it has n't already .
The questions are how much and under what circumstances .
`` If nothing happens abroad and the Fed is forced to ease here to calm markets , the dollar is going to go down ; there would be a flight to quality as people start to worry about the U.S. financial system , '' says Michael D. Andrews , a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co .
As a result , options traders were forced to sell elsewhere , driving futures and stock prices lower , traders said .
That selling could pull futures prices lower as well , triggering another round of program selling .

But while the New York Stock Exchange did n't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos .
Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures .
The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .

Arbitragers could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had .
As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart .
Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board .
At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points .
